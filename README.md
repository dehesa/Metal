Metal
-----

This repository contains sample code for Metal: Apple's GPU APIs. It started from Warren Moore's _Metal by Example_ Objective-C book sample code, but I continue adding more as I learned. The repo is very useful to check how Metal behaves in different platforms, what did it change from one Metal version to another, and how the evolution of swift is affecting the APIs.

#### Support
- Platforms: macOS, iOS
- Swift: 4.0
- Metal: 2.0
